# copilot_prompting_assistant
This project is a two-stage system designed to dynamically generate highly specific AI instructions based on a continuously updated Critical Risk Profile derived from software issue data (bugs, security findings)

# Workflow
| Stage        | Script                  | Purpose                                              | Key Action                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1: Analysis  | `1_analyzer_feedback.py`| Ingests new issue data (JSON array).                | Updates the persistent Critical Risk Profile based on score.              |
| 2: Compilation| `2_compiler_generator.py`| Loads the latest risk profile.                      | Generates unique, targeted Master Prompts—one for each critical finding—for AI consumption. |

# How to run

1. Prepare Issue Data: Create a JSON file (e.g., findings.json) containing an array of issues, each with SCORE, KEY_FINDING, ID, and DESCRIPTION.
2. python 1_analyzer_feedback.py findings.json
3. python 2_compiler_generator.py

# Output
Context File (Managed by config.py): Stores the latest CRITICAL_RISK_SCORE and PRIMARY_RISKS.

Prompt Audit Files: Generated by Stage 2, e.g., final_copilot_prompt_SEC-01.txt.

History Log: master_prompt_history.txt (Saves the before/after state of the master prompt).
